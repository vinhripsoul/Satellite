The purpose of the project is to stimulate a debris removal mission in MATLAB to bring a defunct GPS satellite to a disposal orbit using Hohmann transfer, bi-elliptic transfer, vis-viva, and other principles of orbital maneuver.
Cost analysis was performed to find the optimal routes of maneuver, saving on Delta-V and time required for the mission, ultimately saving costs.
Running the code will generate relevant data, alongside with a 3D plot of the satellite orbits, ground traces of the satellite and the dead GPS, observation plots of elevation vs Azimuthi of both the Maui Optical and Supercomputing Site (MOSS) sensor and the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) sensor
